The free version of Inbound Brew has everything you need to generate leads that convert. Free of charge, this marketing plugin supplies the following:

= Push Posts to Social Media (Immediate and Scheduled) = 
You’ve just created a great post that the world should see. Time to copy/paste it into Facebook… or is it? Our plugin will do the heavy lifting for you by posting to Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn either immediately or on a schedule that you determine… or both.

= Custom CTA Buttons (Calls To Action) = 
Now that users are seeing your social media posts and following through to your website, prompt them to take action on your page with custom CTA buttons. Our plugin allows you to easily create and place CTA buttons anywhere on your website. Driving users to your landing pages has never been easier.

= Custom Landing Pages (with no coding necessary!) = 
Up until now, creating custom Landing Pages in WordPress required some level of coding. Not anymore! Now you can easily create landing pages that highlight all of the reasons why your users should enter their information and grab that juicy bit of content you’ve created.

= Custom Forms and Lead Capturing = 
Our custom forms tool makes it easy to gather the information you need from your leads. Customize your form fields and then paste the shortcode anywhere on your website! Capturing leads has never been so easy!

= Automate Emails and Deliver Secure Content = 
Now that your customer has clicked the CTA button, visited your Landing Page, and determined that they want your content, it’s time for you to deliver! After a lead submits your form, greet them with a custom, automated email and a secure link to download your stellar content. Our email tool allows you to reach your leads in seconds and deliver content they care about. 

= Lead Management (CRM) = 
Stay organized and on top of your leads with our lead management tool. Create custom views, notate a phone call, send follow-up emails, and track all of a lead’s activity… It’s basically everything you need to drive your prospects through the pipeline and convert leads to a customer, or a customer to an evangelist. 

= Manage Redirects = 
Did you change a post URL, migrate from another site, or otherwise alter your site structure? Our plugin allows you to accommodate these changes with exact-match redirects, wildcard redirects, and more. Don’t lose any SEO juice that you’ve already earned! Use Inbound Brew to redirect those users to the right place. 

= SEO Management =  
Keep your website running smoothly and search engine friendly with our SEO management tool. Our plugin automatically updates your sitemap and robots.txt file as you make changes to your website, ensuring those search engines both like you and know how to find you!

= Top Bar and Before You Leave CTAs = 
Now available in our [Pro version](https://inboundbrew.com/features/ "Pro version"), you can create engaging Top Bar CTAs and PopUp CTAs prior to a user leaving your site! 

= Automated Email Drip Campaigns = 
Also available in our [Pro version](https://inboundbrew.com/features/ "Pro version"), you can automated email drip campaigns right in your WordPress admin. No need for other pricey services like MailChimp, Mandril, Sendgrid, Constant Conact, or Infusionsoft! 


***All of this for free? But why?***

= Can't I do all of this with existing tools? =

YYou can find tutorials if you google "WordPress vs Hubspot" that will teach you how to make WordPress function more like Hubspot, then you can manually download a dozen plugins and install them, then configure them, then hope they don't conflict, then do a little coding to integrate it into your theme, then make sure each is updated, then check them every time you update WordPress Core, then pull your hair out and curse the amount of time you spend maintaining this house of cards you've built.
