	    <h1>Understanding the Features</h1>
	    <div>Each feature has a different purpose, but they all "brew" together to help you generate leads.</div>
	    <br/><br/>
	    <h2 class='ib-getting-started-header'><span class="fa fa-bullhorn fa-2"></span>Call To Actions (CTAs)</h2>
	    <div class='ib-getting-started-wrapper'>
		    <div class='ib-getting-started-text'>
			    It all starts with a CTA. A CTA, or "Call To Action," is something that draws the attention of your visitors and spurs them to take action. Usually, it is a button or a graphic that offers something enticing, such as "Download Our New eBook Now," or "Click Here to Start Saving Money!" What you put on the CTA depends on your business and what you are offering, but generally, the CTA should direct the user to a Landing Page. 
			    <br/>
			    <br/>
			    <a target='_blank'  href="<?php echo get_admin_url()."admin.php?page=ib-call-to-action"; ?>">> take me there <</a>
				
			</div>
		</div>

		<h2 class='ib-getting-started-header'><span class="fa fa-file-text-o fa-2"></span>Landing Pages</h2>
	    <div class='ib-getting-started-wrapper'>
		    <div class='ib-getting-started-text'>
		    	A Landing Page sounds confusing, but it's really simple. Basically, you are hoping that, eventually, all of your visitors "land" on a page that offers them something in exchange for their email address (and/or other info). This could be an eBook, Whitepaper, video course, slideshow, coupon code, or whatever makes sense for your business. The Landing Page has only one purpose: tell them exactly what they are going to get (and make it juicy!) if they fill out the form. That's it! 
		    	<br/>
			    <br/>
		    	<a target='_blank' href="<?php echo get_admin_url()."admin.php?page=landing-page-admin"; ?>">> show me the goods <</a>
			</div>
		</div>

		<h2 class='ib-getting-started-header'><span class="fa fa-list-alt fa-2"></span>Contact Forms</h2>
	    <div class='ib-getting-started-wrapper'>
		    <div class='ib-getting-started-text'>
		    	The Contact Forms feature allows you to make custom contact forms that you can sprinkle through your site and/or use on a Landing Page. Essentially, you decide what you want to collect, the email the user will receive, and the content (if any) the user will get once the form is submitted. With these forms, you can use the "default" fields we have built in, or build your own. Remember, every field on the contact form represents a possible field that may be captured and tracked with your leads. 
		    	<br/>
		    	<br/>
		    	<a target='_blank' href="<?php echo get_admin_url()."admin.php?page=ib-contact-forms"; ?>">> pictures or it didn't happen <</a>
			</div>
		</div>


		<h2 class='ib-getting-started-header'><span class="fa fa-envelope-o fa-2"></span>Email</h2>
	    <div class='ib-getting-started-wrapper'>
		    <div class='ib-getting-started-text'>
		    	We offer a simple, clean HTML email template to quickly and easily get started sending professional emails to your leads. The templates set your header and footer styles, color schemes, and company social media links. Once a template is created, you can create a new "email" based on that template. That email will have specific content in the body and can use any of the lead fields gathered to dynamically create personal and engaging emails for your leads.
		    	<br/><br/>
		    	You can also decide if the email will send downloadable content to your lead or not. If you send content, that content can be "locked down" so it can only be downloaded a limited number of times, preventing your leads from forwarding the email to others, and also preventing random visitors and bots/crawlers from finding your precious content without filling out a form.
		    	<br/>
			    <br/>
		    	<a target='_blank' href="<?php echo get_admin_url()."admin.php?page=ib-email-admin"; ?>">> I don't believe it until I see it <</a>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class='ib-getting-started-header'><span class="fa fa-users fa-2"></span>Leads</h2>
	    <div class='ib-getting-started-wrapper'>
		    <div class='ib-getting-started-text'>
		    	Now that you have leads, you should keep track of them! Our Leads feature is a slimmed-down, no-nonsense CRM that allows you to view lead activity, send emails, take notes, and rate your leads. You can add custom properties to your leads module at any time, thereby collecting the data that matters to you.
		   		<br/><br/>
		    	Our Leads feature also allows you to create and save dynamic views, making it easier to group your leads into a sales pipeline that makes sense. "New Leads," "Opportunities," "Qualified," and "Customers" are just some examples of groups and views you should make in order to properly work your pipeline.
		    	<br/>

		    	<a target='_blank' href="<?php echo get_admin_url()."admin.php?page=ib-leads-admin"; ?>">> Lead the way! #dadjoke <</a>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class='ib-getting-started-header'><span class="fa fa-key fa-2"></span>Keywords</h2>
	    <div class='ib-getting-started-wrapper'>
		    <div class='ib-getting-started-text'>
		    	Don't overthink keywords, but don't forget them, either. Spend some time with <a href="https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/" target="_blank">Google's Keyword Planner</a>, then enter the phrases you care about into our module. Our on-page SEO module will make sure to remind you to use the keyword phrases you care about as you create content, ensuring you keep it top-of-mind.
		    	<br/>
			    <br/>
		    	<a target='_blank' href="<?php echo get_admin_url()."admin.php?page=keyword-admin"; ?>">> let's do this thing <</a>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class='ib-getting-started-header'><span class="fa fa-random fa-2"></span>Redirects</h2>
	    <div class='ib-getting-started-wrapper'>
		    <div class='ib-getting-started-text'>
		    	This part may be a little complicated, but it doesn't need to be. Essentially, Google and others crawl your site for content all the time. Each page has a unique link (URL) so the bots know where to find the content. When you change those links/URLs, all of that sweet SEO juice you've been working on is lost... or is it? If you setup a redirect, it tells the bots "Hey, that content moved over here!" Instead of being lost forever, the bots will update their masters (Google, Bing, etc), and you will retain all of that SEO magic you've been working on. 
		    	<br/><br/>
		    	Also, if you change a link/URL by renaming a page or post slug, don't worry! We'll put in the redirect for you! For the most part, only advanced users will be messing around with this feature on a regular basis.
		    	<br/>
			    <br/>
		    	<a target='_blank' href="<?php echo get_admin_url()."admin.php?page=ib-redirects"; ?>">> Re-direct me there! <</a>
			</div>
		</div>
